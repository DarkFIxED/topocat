# About
Topocat is a lightweight cloud-based solution for collabote over geo-data with your private teams.

Purpose of software: to provide the ability to work with geographic data. For example, there are a handful of like-minded people who want to share any points in the forest on a map between themselves so that no one else knows about them.

The service development stage is proof-of-concept, it is even less than the Minimal Viable Product. While there is a collection of information from the focus group. A lot of bugs, terrible design, imperfections (index and about in general with stubs) are possible, while all AS IS. If you run into problems or understand that there is a feature you cannot live without, then report here, please: https://github.com/DarkFIxED/topocat/issues. But we are constantly working on project improvements =)
